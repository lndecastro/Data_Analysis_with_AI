# Class 3: Data Visualization and Design Principles

This class focuses on the visualization of data, covering distributions, associations, proportions, trends, and geospatial analysis. It introduces key design principles for effective data visualization and shows how AI can assist in creating impactful visual representations to uncover insights and communicate findings clearly.

## Hands-on activities and prompts:

### 1. Boxplot and Violin Plot with AI

Version 1:
```
Generate the boxplot and the violin plot for the iris dataset of Fisher.
```
Version 2:
```
Act as a data visualization specialist. Using the provided Iris dataset, create side-by-side boxplots and violin plots for each numeric feature (sepal/petal length and width), grouped by species. Include axis labels, a size legend, and a color legend.
```

### 2. Bubble Chart with AI

Version 1:
```
Generate a bubble chart for the gapminder dataset attached having variable ‘HDI Index’ in the x-axis, variable 'Life Expectancy' on the y-axis, variable ‘co2_consump’ as the bubble size, and variable 'continent' as the bubble color.
```
Version 2:
```
Act as a data visualization specialist. Using the provided Gapminder dataset, plot a bubble chart showing:
X-axis: 'HDI Index'
Y-axis: 'Life Expectancy'
Bubble size: 'co2_consump'
Bubble color: 'continent'
Include axis labels, a size scale, and a color legend.
```

Version 1:
```
Generate a bubble chart for the mpg dataset attached having variable 'Acceleration' in the x-axis, variable 'MPG' on the y-axis, variable 'horsepower' as the bubble size, and variable 'cylinders' as the bubble color.
```

Version 2:
```
Act as a data visualization specialist. Using the provided mpg dataset, generate a bubble chart showing:
X-axis: 'Acceleration'
Y-axis: 'MPG'
Bubble size: 'horsepower'
Bubble color: 'cylinders'
Include axis labels, a size legend, and a color legend.
```

### 3. Scatterplot Matrix and Heatmap with AI

Version 1:
```
Generate the scatterplot matrix and correlation heatmap for the attached Iris dataset of Fisher
```

Version 2:
```
Act as a data analyst. Using the provided Iris dataset, generate:
A scatterplot matrix of all numeric variables, colored by species.
A correlation heatmap of those variables, annotated with correlation coefficients.
```

### 4. Bar Charts with AI

Version 1:
```
Generate the following visuals for the mammographic mass dataset:
1) A bar chart having the bars combining variables 'shape' and 'severity'.
2) A grouped bar chart for variable 'shape' by 'severity'.
3) A bar chart with the count of each category for variable 'severity'.
```

Version 2:
```
Act as a data analyst. Using the provided mammographic masses dataset, generate:
A stacked bar chart of 'shape' within each 'severity' category.
A grouped bar chart of 'shape' by 'severity'.
A bar chart of counts for each 'severity' level.
```

### 5. Pie and Doughnut Charts, and Treemap

Version 1:
```
Plot a pie chart, a doughnut chart, and a bar chart for variable 'margin' of the mammographic dataset.
```
Version 2:
```
Act as a data analyst. Using the provided mammographic dataset, generate:
A pie chart of the 'margin' variable.
A donut chart of the 'margin' variable.
A bar chart of the 'margin' variable.
```
Version 1:
```
For the attached gapminder_data_graphs dataset plot a treemap of the global GDP by Country and Continent for values greater than 5% per continent.
```
Version 2:
```
Act as a data visualization specialist. Using the attached Gapminder dataset:
Filter to countries whose GDP share exceeds 5% within their continent. 
Then plot a treemap grouped by continent and sized by GDP value.
```

### 6. Line, Sankey, and Gantt Charts with AI

Version 1:
```
Generate a line chart with the 'life expectancy' by 'continent' over time for the Gapminder dataset.
```
Version 2:
```
Act as a data analyst. Using the provided Gapminder dataset: 
Plot a line chart of 'life expectancy' by 'continent' over time.
```

Version 1:
```
Create a Sankey chart for a potential career path at an American university
```
Version 2:
```
Act as a career counselor. Generate a Sankey chart illustrating a typical American university career path: 
Nodes for undergraduate majors, graduate programs, and job sectors.
Flows showing student transitions between them.
```

Version 1:
```
Create a Gantt chart for a hypothetical project on the building of a house
```
Version 2:
```
Act as a project manager. Identify appropriate phases of a hypothetical house-building project and generate a Gantt chart to represent the project.
```

### 7. Choropleth and Bubble Maps with AI

Version 1:
```
Create some choropleth and bubble maps with the Gapminder dataset.
```
Version 2:
```
Act as a geospatial analyst. Using the provided Gapminder dataset, generate:
A world choropleth map of GDP per capita along the years.
Bubble maps along the years, sizing bubbles by population and coloring by continent.
```
