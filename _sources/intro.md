# Data Analysis with AI (DA2I)

Welcome to the "Data Analysis with AI" (DA2I) training led by Dr. Leandro Nunes de Castro at Florida Gulf Coast University. This course is designed to introduce you to the core principles of data analysis and demonstrate how artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance every stage of the data analysis process, from summarizing and visualizing data to developing compelling data stories and dashboards.

Throughout the training, you will:
- Explore the fundamentals of data analysis and AI-enhanced techniques.
- Gain practical experience with leading AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude.ai, and Perplexity, learning how they can assist in summarizing, interpreting, and visualizing data.
- Understand the main careers in data science and the skills required for each role, including data analyst, data scientist, machine learning engineer, and more.
- Learn best practices in data storytelling, dashboard design, and prompt engineering to extract and communicate insights effectively.
- Discuss important topics such as the limitations, ethics, and accuracy of AI-generated outputs.

No programming experience is required. The focus is on building your ability to extract business-oriented insights, visualize relationships, and tell impactful stories with data, both with and without AI. By the end of this course, you will be equipped to apply AI-augmented workflows to real-world data projects and contribute to a data-driven culture in any organization.

## 1.2 Datasets Summary

The training uses a diverse set of datasets to illustrate practical data analysis and AI-augmented workflows. Here is a summary of the datasets featured in the examples:

- **Car Evaluation Dataset**: Contains attributes such as buying price, maintenance cost, doors, seating capacity, trunk size, safety, and an overall acceptability class. Used for data description, tabular representation, and creating data dictionaries. [Download the Cars dataset.](./mpg.csv)
- **Mammographic Masses Dataset**: Medical dataset with variables like BI-RADS assessment, patient age, mass shape, margin, density, and severity (benign or malignant). Used for handling missing values, sampling, and contingency analysis. [Download the Mammographic dataset.](./mammographic_masses_nominal.csv)
- **Iris Dataset**: Classic dataset with sepal and petal measurements for three iris species. Demonstrates normalization and descriptive statistics. [Download the Iris dataset.](./Iris.csv)
- **Forest Fires Dataset**: Contains data on forest fires in Portugal, including location, date, meteorological indices, temperature, humidity, wind, rain, and area burned. Used for distribution analysis, frequency tables, and association measures. [Download the Forest Fires dataset.](./forestfires.csv)
- **Gapminder Dataset**: Features global development indicators such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, and population for multiple countries over time. Commonly used to demonstrate time series analysis, multi-dimensional visualization, and global trend exploration. [Download the Gapminder dataset.](./gapminder_data_graphs.csv)
- **Superstore Sales Dataset**: Comprises transactional sales data from a retail superstore, including order details, customer demographics, product categories, sales, profit, and shipping information. Used to illustrate business analytics, dashboard creation, and data storytelling. [Download the Super Store Sales dataset.](./Superstore_Sales_Dataset_Original2.csv)

These datasets provide a comprehensive foundation for exploring data preparation, descriptive analysis, visualization, and AI-driven insights throughout the training.

## 1.3 GenAI Tools to be Studied

Here is a brief description and comparison of the three main GenAI tools to be used in this course, including links to access them:
